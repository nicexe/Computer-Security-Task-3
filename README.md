# Computer-Security-Task-3
This is the third task that I have to deliver on a Computer Security course I am attending

##Experimenting with Keylogging Tools
One method of compromising the confidentiality of data is with a tool called a keylogger. A keylogger will record the keystrokes typed on the keyboard and store them down in a file that can be viewed by the person performing the monitoring in real time or at a later time. Keyloggers, as a surveillance tool, are often used by employers to ensure employees use work computers for business purposes only. Unfortunately, keyloggers can also be embedded in spyware allowing your information to be transmitted to an unknown third party.

There are two types of keyloggers: software-based and hardware-based. For this task, you will experiment with software-based keyloggers. Software keyloggers can be broken down into 2 sub-categories: Visible in the task manager and Invisible and stealth keyloggers. You will create your own keylogger (visible in the task manager). Either start from scratch or find code segments from other sources (in the latter case, make sure to document the source you use). Generate some information to test your keylogger and analyze the output in the file. You are free to use a programming language of your choice.

**Deliverables:**

1. A document in **pdf** format that demonstrates the functionality of the program (screenshots) and a *read me* section on how to run the program.
2. The source code of the program
